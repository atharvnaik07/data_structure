## ðŸš€ How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/atharvnaik07/data_structure.git
   ```
2. **Compile the C++ Code:**
   - Use any C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Visual Studio) to compile `.cpp` files.
   - Example:
     ```bash
     g++ -o infix_to_postfix infix_to_postfix.cpp
     ./infix_to_postfix
     ```
3. **Run Executables:**
   - Use the precompiled `.exe` files for quick execution.

4. **Modify the Code:**
   - Customize and expand the implementations as needed for learning or projects.
